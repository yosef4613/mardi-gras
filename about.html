    <h2 class="fr text-center">The origins of Mardi Gras</h2>
    <p>The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in the 17th and 18th
      centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf Gras," or fatted calf,
      followed France to her colonies.
    </p>
    <p> On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a plot of
      ground
      60 miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men realized it was the eve
      of the festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702.
      In
      1703, the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.</p>

      <p>Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. In 2003, she joined the board
        of the Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the association in 2004.[4] After the 2005
        levee failures in Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely
        and remained mostly deserted for months afterward. In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a
        blue-ribbon panel convened by then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five
        other New Orleans neighborhoods to be converted into greenspace.[5][6] In her role as president of the
        association, Cantrell worked with residents and local religious leaders to organize opposition to the panel's
        recommendation. She also helped enlist returning Broadmoor residents in a six-month effort to write a recovery
        plan for the neighborhood.[7]

      </p>

      <p>
        Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from 2006 through 2012. She and fellow
        residents formed the Broadmoor School Board, overseeing the reopening and renovation of the Andrew H. Wilson
        school.[8] She served as a founding board member of the Broadmoor Development Corporation, a community
        development corporation that provided case management and other social services for returning residents.[9] She
        was involved with residents' efforts to reopen Broadmoor's Rosa F. Keller Library, which won a $2 million grant
        from the Carnegie Endowment.[10] She created a partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and
        Church of the Annunciation, which provided the neighborhood association with office space and hosted volunteer
        groups.[11] She also formed a partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and her home parish,
        Blessed Trinity Catholic Church, to open the Broadmoor Art and Wellness Center.[12]</p>

    <p> In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our current
      Mardi
      Gras krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded from 1711 through
      1861. The procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade
      with an actual bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.
    </p>
    <p>
      New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in New Orleans,
      but not with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil,
      established elegant society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today.
    </p>
    <p> The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial governing body.
      That year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of clubs and carnival
      organizations formed in New Orleans.

    </p>
    <p> By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback riders to
      celebrate
      Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and lent each event an
      exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus,
      invoking John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New Orleans
      with dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous.</p>
    <p> In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was formed. This is also the first recorded
      account
      of Mardi Gras "throws."</p>
    <p> Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and they even printed "Carnival Edition" lithographs
      of
      parades' fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes and floats were always carefully guarded
      before the procession). At first, these reproductions were small, and details could not be clearly seen. But
      beginning in 1886 with Proteus' parade "Visions of Other Worlds," these chromolithographs could be produced in
      full, saturated color, doing justice to the float and costume designs of Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and
      B.A. Wikstrom. Each of these designers' work was brought to life by talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges
      Soulie', who for 40 years was responsible for creating all of Carnival's floats and processional outfits.</p>
    <p> 1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King of Carnival, Rex, to preside over the first
      daytime
      parade. To honor the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the businessmen introduced Romanoff's family
      colors of purple, green and gold as Carnival's official colors. Purple stands for justice; gold for power; and
      green for faith. This was also the Mardi Gras season that Carnival's improbable anthem, "If Ever I Cease to Love,"
      was cemented, due in part to the Duke's fondness for the tune.</p>
    <p> The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in New Orleans instead of France, culminating with
      Comus' magnificent "The Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species," in which exotic paper-mache' animal costumes
      served as the basis for Comus to mock both Darwin's theory and local officials, including Governor Henry Warmoth.
      In 1875, Governor Warmoth signed the "Mardi Gras Act," making Fat Tuesday a legal holiday in Louisiana, which it
      still is.</p>
    <p>Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes today developed from private social clubs with
      restrictive membership policies. Since all of these parade organizations are completely funded by their members,
      New Orleanians call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"</p>
